This JavaScript code provides functionalities to manipulate and generate payloads aimed at bypassing security filters in web applications. It includes options for encoding URLs, encoding HTML, and obfuscating JavaScript scripts. These techniques are useful for evading detection by security systems and exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. By making the payloads more complex and less recognizable to security filters, the code helps highlight potential flaws in the application and enhance security against malicious attacks.
